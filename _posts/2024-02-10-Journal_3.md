#### Nike Running
As of today, currently in 9.2 km / 200 km (One day Vacation)

#### What I did today
I left the base at 8:30 and got into the taxi that went to Taehwagang Station, which has a train that heads to my Grandmother's house. It took around 50 minutes to get to the destination, and I was welcomed with a breakfast. After finishing the breakfast, I called my mom to show that I was healthy but she kept saying I gained too much weight, which I didn't agree with. The rest of the day was pretty much me playing Genshin, doing the Lunar Event, saying goodbye to Uncle's family and greeting Aunt's family. For dinner, I ate beef with soju and drank an extra can of beer and talked with the family until my dad arrived. Then Aunt's family left shortly after and I slept right away.


#### One thing that I did good
Gave a life lesson to my cousin who is currently lazy.
