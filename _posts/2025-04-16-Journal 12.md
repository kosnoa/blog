#### Why I left this blog without anything?
During my service, I like to write a journal many as possible until I started to get too busy with my works that I had to do. This resulted me to be careless with this and it stopped from March 27, 2024. 

#### What I have been doing since then?
I finished my service as of March 4, 2025 and currently seeking for part-time jobs and studying before I go back to Canada. While that goes on I went to a lot J-POP concerts that happened in Korea and some in Japan (ZMTY MY GOAT). I will try to use this blog more often as possible and I hope you look forward to this.

#### What I did today
I had 2 interviews for part-time job (pretty suprising that I got them) and they went pretty well than I have expected. One interview was for Summer School TA and the other one was for NA Seeding part-time job. Seeding part-time's result is known in a week and the other one will be known around May.
