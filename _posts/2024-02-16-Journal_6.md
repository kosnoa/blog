#### Nike Running
As of today, currently in 11 km / 200 km 

#### What I did today
Pretty much did nothing compared to the previous days, until the fresh member arrived to my base. It was approximately 4 months since a person came to our base, which made everyone excited including myself. I first thought he would go to 8CO because 5CO has more soliders than 8CO but since he was a rifleman, he had to be a member of 5CO. After knowing that my next guess, and majority's guess was him joining 5th barrack as there were 2 solider leaving in 3 months, one in March and one in May. However, our vice-leader chose my barrack for him to stay, which in first place we all disagreed but later had to give up as he convinced us. So, my life in military has changed as I now also have a person below me. 

#### One thing that I did good
Welcomed the new colleague who joined to my barrack.
