#### Nike Running
As of today, currently in 9.2 km / 200 km (Still in Vacation)


#### What I did today
After waking up around 8:30 (Sleeping longer was impossible), I ate breakfast then continued watching my phone while my dad was chatting with my grandmother, who was super excited when talking with my dad. Around 11:00, we left the house to go to the Spa that is located inside the luxerious mall. The price was high compared to the other places, and it had a time limit of 4 hours, but this thought disappeared as soon I walked into the public bath area, which was "Price worth" area. I spent nearly an hour there enjoying my time with water massages, while my dad got his skin scrubbed by the worker. After leaving the bath area, we headed to the sauna area, where it was crowded and filled with people that we had no choice of choosing menu except for ramen (It was still delicious as it was customable). After chit-chatting with my dad, I had to return to the base, which was depressing. The return to the base is always stressful but thinking about the time I spent outside motivates me to work harder.

#### One thing that I did good
Gave my seat to an elderly person.
