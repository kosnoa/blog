#### What I did today
The entire day was all about shooting. Since I got my new gun, K2C1, in last December, I had to adjust my iron sight for my new gun. So in the morning, I went to the shooting range that is located inside the base. After shooting 10 bullets, I got my sight adjusted then shortly after, I ate my lunch, which was mid considering that the menu was Pho. Around 13:00, everyone except for the shifters left the base to the shooting range where the result from here are highly influenced to our promotion. I had 0 experience shooting in that place until today, which made me nervous. But this disappeared as I positioned my gun and aimed for the target. Though I still missed the easy 50m and 200m solo targets. Surprisingly, I had managed to shoot the hard targets including the positions that I had never shot with before and managed to get 18 out of 20 on target, which is the Tier 0, I am now safe without shooting for the next 6 months. After shooting, I talked with the ambulance driver who happened to be the person I met during the welcome event hosted by the (여단 영어로 찾아볼것). The day went through with night shooting, which I got 9 out of 10. Then returned to base.
