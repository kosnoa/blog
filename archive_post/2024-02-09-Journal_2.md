#### Nike Running
As of today, currently in 9.2 km / 200 km (Due to Back Pain)

#### What I did today
Around 09:00 left the base to Daewangam Park with military colleagues. I have been to this place around 3 months ago during a camp hosted by the brigade. The weather was pretty chill that my hand felt icy cold. The place was silient as there were close to no people in the park, which was the opposite of what I have heard before visiting. After walking around the park shortly, I bought caramel macchiato to melt my cold hands then returned to the base. I spent most of my time playing Pokemon Blaze Black 2 Redux and watching some Youtube videos.
(As of Feb 8th, Autonomous Shift has started)

#### One thing that I did good today
Lend my power bank to my senior colleague who urgently needed it.
